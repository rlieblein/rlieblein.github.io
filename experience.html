          <p class="lead">At Mindtree, I worked on a 3 person team to build a web application focused on enhancing the client-employee interaction experience. We implemented OAuth2.0 using an Apache server to have clients and Mindtree employees log into their secure accounts on Version One, an agile lifecycle management software, from our website and view tracking of projects and show unique displays of data containing progression and efficiency. We coded our website using HTML, CSS, AngularJS, and JSON. We followed the agile project management guidelines throughout the entire internship, including many meetings and a lot of interaction with our colleagues.</p>

            <p class="lead">I began playing soccer at a really young age and since I am so passionate about the sport, I decided to explore other options of the soccer world as well. I started working as a referee in South Florida when I was in 10th grade. My boss loved my ability to control a game so much that she allowed me to officiate 12th grade games. Now, I continue officiate games all over Florida and have yet to lose any passion for the game.</p>

            <p class="lead">Travelling is my favorite thing to do. So, I figured, why not travel and study at the same time? I decided to spend an entire spring semester in Sydney, Australia then travel to Thailand, Singapore, and the Phillipines for a month after finals were over. I arrived in Sydney homeless and it took me about a week to find a place to stay. However, I fell in love with the country immediately. I travelled the entire Eastern coast of Australia from Melbourne to Cairns. That being said, my favorite place was where I lived: Bondi Beach, Australia (picture provided). I would like to find a Software Development job in Australia for a few years after I finish school.</p>

          <p class="lead">I founded a community service fundraiser when I was in 9th grade. I started this project before the Easter of 2009. I reached out to the guidance counselor and principal at an underprivileged school, North Side Elementary School, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I realized I was going to make a select few of students and their families have wonderful Easters and Christmasâ€™ and pick a few new families every holiday. I raised money through different avenues, biannually, and was able to make these kids have an Easter or Christmas they would never forget.</p>

I spent one summer at the Business Program at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business and another summer at Engineering Program at the University of Michigan College of Engineering.
